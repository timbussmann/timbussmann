title: Actual Advice #1: Start small
---


This is the first blog post of a format I'd like to to use to share advice I got from all sorts of people. There is so much advice out there that in most cases, you'll always find someone defending and someone else challenging any type of advice. I'd like to share the advise that worked for me, that made me better, not necessarily only at my job.


I received this first advice from my colleague and co-worker Daniel Marbach. While he is a genious software engineer, he is also a gym enthusiast. Some day, I expressed my frustration about the lack of enjoyment and motivation I get from doing fitness exercises. I've mostly tried bodyweight training as I could do my exercises at home. But I even failed at completing exercise plans several time. I struggled to find motivation, causing me to find excuses to skip a training again and again until at some point you just stop completely because you give up all your hope of achieving your training plan. Daniel's advise was very simple and you probably wonder why I even bother to write this down: Set yourself a goal that you are confident to be achieveable every single time. For me, this goal was to do my bodyweight exercises once a week.

Admitedly, this goal is not very ambitious and every fitness trainer would probably also tell me how inefficient this is but this is not what this is about. The goal should help you to build up a new habit. And for this, this workes like a charm. At the time of writing this, I did my exercises once every single week for about 6 months. This is far beyond the timeframe I managed to keep up my exercise schedule before and the habit of doing my exercises became more and more natural. Doing your exercises once a week consistently over a many months or years is still better than doing it three times a week for only a month.

Obviously, this won't make me the next Arnold Schwarzenegger and clearly, that's not my goal. But you might say this approach is not very ambitious and it is bad advice for people looking to improve their career or business. But in contrary, this approach of setting yourself achievable goals and getting into the habbit of meeting them might be exactly what you need. Once you have identified what you really want to improve at, start with small goals, start with goals that you can actually achieve. Setting absurdely high goals that you can't meet almost all of the time will make you start ignoring those. You'll constantly miss your ambitious goals and you'll start not bother anymore. You'll probably even become frustrated and give up. Achievable goals will help you to keep you motivated, they will help you to build up your skills reliably. Whether you're facing a big refactoring, ambitious business growth plans or mount everest, you will only achieve them step by step, and I mean very small steps. There is no easy way (of course you can always bet on pure luck but do yourself the favor and calculate the odds if you think that will work for you). 

You can apply this general advise to many things:
* Become fitter or healthier by getting into the habit of doing exercises or cooking. Don't expect to change your lifestyle at once.
* Learn new skills, like a new programming language. Don't expect yourself to write a full application using a new language right away.
* Get your first user or one additional customer for your side-project or business. Don't expect your project to explode on Hacker News.

It's totally okay to have big dreams, visions, ambitions, just don't expect yourself to be able to pull of everything you need to achieve your big dreams right away.

I don't want to make too generic "calendar wisdom" statements here but don't worry about starting slow, keep the pace that lets you keep going.
